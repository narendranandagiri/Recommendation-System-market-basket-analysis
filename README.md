# Market Basket Analysis
When you go to the supermarket, usually the first thing you do is grab a shopping cart. As you move up and down the aisles, you will pick up certain items and place them in your shopping cart. Most of these items may correspond to a shopping list that was prepared ahead of time, but other items may have been selected spontaneously. Let’s presume that when you check out at the cashier, the contents of your (and every other shopper’s) cart are logged, because the supermarket wants to see if there are any patterns in selection that occur from one shopper to another. This is called market basket analysis.

Market basket analysis is a process that looks for relationships of objects that “go together” within the business context. In reality, market basket analysis goes beyond the supermarket scenario from which its name is derived. Market basket analysis is the analysis of any collection of items to identify affinities that can be exploited in some manner.
